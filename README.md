### NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING :
For a given dataset of Restaurant Reviews, applied Machine Learning Algorithms to train the dataset to identify if the review is Positive /Negative and classified the given test set of reviews into positive and negative. At first preprocessed the dataset by cleaning the text and applied "BAG OF WORDS" model to create sparse table,where occurence(frequency) of each word is used as feature for training a classifier and used "NAIVE BAYES" algorithm for classification

### ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
For a given dataset of a bank containing list of active and non active users,applied artificial neural network to train the dataset and classified the given test set.Used "K-Fold Cross Validation" to find the accuracies of each epoch and tuned the parameters to achieve high accuracy.
